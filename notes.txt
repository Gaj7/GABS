Starting small, developing incrementally.
1. Integer and Boolean base types, simple expression language. Typing.
2. System F.
3. Global declarations? (Needed for ADT definitions?)
4. ADTs + pattern matching.
5. Remove base types
6. Refinement types?
7. Bitfield types?

Keep pure stuff as its own language, add in build stuff
